                <small>Jan,2022</small>
                <p>For people who don't know about these. EM and REM are two units which we can use as a unit to specify the property of a particular HTML element.Let's take an example to specify font-size of a particular element we generally use pixels(px)
                    and in the same way we can use EM as well as REM.</p><br>

                <small>Jan,2022</small>
                <p>When I was in my graduation 1st year, that was the first time I came across programming languages and I have started learning C language in my 1st year and When I stepped into 2nd year, I came across C++ language as well as Python and
                    when I stepped into 3rd year, I came across Python language and after learning all these languages I feel like logic building is very much important.</p><br>
